            <h1 class="wn-detail-title">Lightspeed Now Speaks French and Spanish</h1>
            <p class="wn-detail-lede">With a single toggle, Lightspeed generates AI responses in English, French, or Spanish &mdash; enabling operators across Canada and beyond to serve customers in their preferred language.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="wn-detail-divider"><hr></div>

        <section class="wn-detail-body">
            <p>Canada is officially bilingual, and many lottery operators serve communities where French is the primary language. Others operate in regions with significant Spanish-speaking populations. Until now, operators in these communities had to manually translate AI-generated responses or maintain separate workflows for each language.</p>

            <p>Today, that changes. Lightspeed now includes native multilingual support with a simple language toggle that switches AI output between English, French, and Spanish. The underlying knowledge base remains in its original language &mdash; the AI handles the translation in real time, producing natural, fluent responses in the target language.</p>

            <h2>What's included</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One-click language toggle</strong> &mdash; A language selector appears in the AI tools interface, letting you switch between English, French, and Spanish before or after generating a response</li>
                <li><strong>Native-quality output</strong> &mdash; Responses are generated natively in the selected language, not machine-translated after the fact. The AI understands context, idiom, and tone in each language</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge base independence</strong> &mdash; Your knowledge base stays in whatever language you wrote it in. The AI cross-references English knowledge base entries to produce accurate responses in French or Spanish</li>
                <li><strong>All tools supported</strong> &mdash; Language selection works across the Response Assistant, Draft Assistant, and Ask Lightspeed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why this matters for Canadian operators</h2>
            <p>For lottery operators in Quebec and other francophone communities, bilingual customer service isn't optional &mdash; it's a regulatory and cultural expectation. Lightspeed's French support means operators can respond to customer inquiries in French with the same speed and accuracy they've come to expect in English, without maintaining duplicate knowledge bases or hiring bilingual staff for every shift.</p>

            <p>Spanish support extends Lightspeed's reach to operators serving Hispanic communities across North America, opening up new markets and improving service for existing customers.</p>

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>The language toggle is available directly in each tool's interface. Select your preferred output language, then generate your response as usual. The AI processes your knowledge base content, applies the context and instructions you've set, and produces the response in the selected language. You can regenerate the same response in a different language with one click to compare outputs.</p>

            <h3>What's next</h3>
            <p>We're evaluating additional languages based on operator demand. Portuguese, Mandarin, and Punjabi are among the languages we're considering for future releases. Let us know which languages would help your team the most.</p>
