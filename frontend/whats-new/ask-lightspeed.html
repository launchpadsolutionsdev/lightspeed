            <h1 class="wn-detail-title">Deep Dive: Ask Lightspeed</h1>
            <p class="wn-detail-lede">Ask Lightspeed is your organization's always-available AI assistant &mdash; a freeform tool that can answer operational questions, draft donor emails, brainstorm strategies, and handle any task that benefits from your organization's context.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="wn-detail-divider"><hr></div>

        <section class="wn-detail-body">
            <p>The Response Assistant handles customer inquiries. The Draft Assistant handles marketing content. But what about everything else? The one-off questions that don't fit neatly into a template. The ad-hoc tasks that come up every day &mdash; drafting a quick email to a donor, summarizing meeting notes, writing a sponsorship pitch, or figuring out how to handle an unusual player situation.</p>

            <p>Ask Lightspeed is the tool for everything else. It's a freeform AI assistant that has full access to your organization's knowledge base, draw schedules, and context. Ask it anything, and it responds with the same accuracy and organizational awareness as the specialized tools &mdash; because it uses the same underlying intelligence.</p>

            <h2>Key capabilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freeform input</strong> &mdash; No forms, no dropdowns, no templates required. Type your question or task in natural language, and Ask Lightspeed responds with a complete, contextual answer</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge-base-aware</strong> &mdash; Like all Lightspeed tools, Ask Lightspeed grounds its responses in your organization's knowledge base. It won't make up policies or invent procedures &mdash; it works with what you've taught it</li>
                <li><strong>Versatile use cases</strong> &mdash; Donor emails, sponsorship pitches, meeting minutes, solicitation strategies, compliance questions, training materials, internal memos &mdash; if it involves your organization's context, Ask Lightspeed can help</li>
                <li><strong>Operational support</strong> &mdash; Need to know your organization's policy on refunds for expired tickets? Ask Lightspeed pulls the answer from your knowledge base instantly, saving you the time of searching through documents</li>
                <li><strong>Brainstorming partner</strong> &mdash; Use Ask Lightspeed to brainstorm campaign ideas, explore new revenue strategies, or think through operational challenges with an AI that understands your specific context</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How it fits in</h2>
            <p>Think of Ask Lightspeed as the generalist that complements Lightspeed's specialist tools. The Response Assistant is purpose-built for customer inquiries with structured inputs. The Draft Assistant is optimized for marketing content with tone and format controls. Ask Lightspeed fills every gap between them &mdash; handling the long tail of tasks that don't fit a structured workflow but still benefit from AI assistance.</p>

            <p>The tool lives in the main navigation alongside the other Lightspeed tools, accessible with one click from anywhere in the dashboard. Its chat-style interface makes it feel like messaging a knowledgeable colleague who happens to have your entire knowledge base memorized.</p>

            <h3>What's next</h3>
            <p>Ask Lightspeed will soon receive a major upgrade with persistent conversations, follow-up refinements, source citations, teach mode, and team collaboration features &mdash; transforming it from a Q&amp;A tool into a full knowledge assistant.</p>
