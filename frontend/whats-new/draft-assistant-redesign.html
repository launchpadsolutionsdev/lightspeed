            <h1 class="wn-detail-title">The Draft Assistant Is Now a Full Writing Studio</h1>
            <p class="wn-detail-lede">We've completely redesigned the Draft Assistant with a two-column layout that gives you more space to compose, preview, and refine marketing content, social media posts, and communications.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="wn-detail-divider"><hr></div>

        <section class="wn-detail-body">
            <p>The Draft Assistant has always been one of Lightspeed's most-used tools. Lottery operators use it to write everything from social media announcements and email campaigns to winner press releases and regulatory communications. But the original single-column layout made it hard to work with longer content and forced users to scroll between their inputs and the generated output.</p>

            <p>The redesigned Draft Assistant takes a fundamentally different approach. A two-column writing studio layout puts your inputs and controls on the left and the generated content on the right, visible side by side at all times. It's the same experience you'd expect from a professional writing tool, purpose-built for lottery marketing and communications.</p>

            <h2>What's changed</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Two-column layout</strong> &mdash; Input controls on the left, generated content on the right. See your prompt and the result simultaneously without scrolling</li>
                <li><strong>Full-width design</strong> &mdash; The Draft Assistant now uses the full available width of your browser window, giving you significantly more workspace</li>
                <li><strong>Card-based content grid</strong> &mdash; Generated drafts are organized in a clean card layout that matches the Response Assistant's design, creating a consistent experience across tools</li>
                <li><strong>Improved editing flow</strong> &mdash; Edit your inputs on the left, regenerate, and see the updated output on the right instantly. No more losing your place in long documents</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why we redesigned it</h2>
            <p>Feedback from operators was consistent: the Draft Assistant needed more room. Teams writing multi-paragraph press releases or detailed email campaigns were fighting the layout instead of focusing on their content. The two-column approach solves this by treating the Draft Assistant as a workspace rather than a form.</p>

            <p>The card-based output grid also brings visual consistency with the Response Assistant, so switching between tools feels natural and familiar.</p>

            <h3>What's next</h3>
            <p>We're exploring inline editing capabilities that would let you modify generated content directly in the output panel, along with template libraries for common content types like winner announcements, draw reminders, and social media campaigns.</p>
