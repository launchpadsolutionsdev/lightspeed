            <h1 class="wn-detail-title">Introducing the Rules of Play Generator</h1>
            <p class="wn-detail-lede">A purpose-built tool that helps charitable lottery operators generate, customize, and maintain compliant Rules of Play documents &mdash; a task that previously took hours of manual drafting and legal review.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="wn-detail-divider"><hr></div>

        <section class="wn-detail-body">
            <p>Every charitable lottery needs a Rules of Play document. These documents define how the lottery operates &mdash; from ticket pricing and draw dates to prize structures and eligibility requirements. Getting them right is critical for regulatory compliance, and getting them wrong can mean delays, fines, or rejected applications.</p>

            <p>Until now, most operators drafted these documents manually, often starting from a previous lottery's rules and adapting them line by line. The Rules of Play Generator changes that by combining your lottery's specific parameters with Lightspeed's understanding of regulatory requirements to produce a complete, professional document in minutes.</p>

            <h2>What's included</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guided input form</strong> &mdash; Enter your lottery's key details (draw dates, ticket prices, prize structure, eligibility rules) in a structured form that ensures nothing gets missed</li>
                <li><strong>AI-powered generation</strong> &mdash; Lightspeed generates a complete Rules of Play document using your inputs, formatted with proper legal structure and clear language</li>
                <li><strong>Section-by-section editing</strong> &mdash; Review and edit each section individually. The AI can regenerate specific sections while preserving your approved changes elsewhere</li>
                <li><strong>Version history</strong> &mdash; Track changes across drafts and compare versions side by side to see exactly what changed between iterations</li>
                <li><strong>Export options</strong> &mdash; Download your finished document in multiple formats ready for regulatory submission or internal review</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Built for lottery operators</h2>
            <p>The Rules of Play Generator was built in direct collaboration with lottery operators who shared the documents they use today. The AI understands the structure, language, and requirements specific to charitable lotteries &mdash; this isn't a generic document generator with lottery prompts bolted on.</p>

            <p>The tool is available from the main dashboard and appears in the bento grid alongside your other Lightspeed tools.</p>

            <h3>What's next</h3>
            <p>We're working on jurisdiction-specific templates and the ability to cross-reference generated rules against regulatory databases for automated compliance checking.</p>
