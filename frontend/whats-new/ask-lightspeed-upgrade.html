            <h1 class="wn-detail-title">Ask Lightspeed Gets Six Powerful New Capabilities</h1>
            <p class="wn-detail-lede">Ask Lightspeed has evolved from a simple Q&amp;A tool into a full-featured knowledge assistant with persistent conversations, source citations, teach mode, and team collaboration.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="wn-detail-divider"><hr></div>

        <section class="wn-detail-body">
            <p>Ask Lightspeed was built to let lottery operators ask questions and get instant, knowledge-base-grounded answers. But as teams started relying on it for more complex workflows, the limitations of a single question-and-answer format became clear. Teams needed to dig deeper, refine answers, and share findings with colleagues.</p>

            <p>Today's upgrade transforms Ask Lightspeed into the kind of tool that can handle those workflows. Six major new features work together to make Ask Lightspeed a true knowledge assistant for your organization.</p>

            <h2>What's new</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Persistent conversations</strong> &mdash; Your conversation history is now saved automatically. Pick up where you left off, revisit past questions, and build on previous answers without starting over</li>
                <li><strong>Follow-up refinements</strong> &mdash; Ask follow-up questions within the same conversation thread. Each response builds on the context of the entire conversation, producing more relevant answers the deeper you go</li>
                <li><strong>Source citations</strong> &mdash; Every response now includes citations linking back to the specific knowledge base entries used. Click any citation to see the source material and verify accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>Teach mode</strong> &mdash; When Lightspeed doesn't have the answer, teach mode lets you add the correct information directly to your knowledge base from within the conversation &mdash; no need to switch to the KB editor</li>
                <li><strong>Context management</strong> &mdash; Control which knowledge base categories and documents are included in each conversation. Focus the AI on the most relevant information for the question at hand</li>
                <li><strong>Team collaboration</strong> &mdash; Share conversations with teammates, bookmark useful threads, and build a searchable library of institutional knowledge that the whole team can access</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>The Ask Lightspeed interface now features a conversation sidebar that lists your recent and bookmarked threads. Each conversation maintains full context, so follow-up questions understand what came before. Source citations appear inline with a clickable reference number, and teach mode activates with a single click when you want to correct or expand the knowledge base.</p>

            <p>This upgrade also includes an engine upgrade to Claude Sonnet 4.6, which powers more accurate, nuanced responses across all six new capabilities.</p>

            <h3>What's next</h3>
            <p>We're working on conversation templates, scheduled reports, and deeper integration between Ask Lightspeed and the Response Assistant so insights from one tool flow seamlessly into the other.</p>
