            <h1 class="wn-detail-title">Deep Dive: The Draft Assistant</h1>
            <p class="wn-detail-lede">From winner announcements to email campaigns, the Draft Assistant helps lottery operators create polished marketing and communications content in minutes &mdash; all grounded in your organization's voice and brand.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="wn-detail-divider"><hr></div>

        <section class="wn-detail-body">
            <p>Running a charitable lottery means constantly communicating with your audience. Draw reminders, winner announcements, early bird promotions, sponsor thank-you's, media releases, social media posts &mdash; the content demands are relentless. Most lottery teams don't have a dedicated marketing department, which means these tasks fall on the same people managing operations, compliance, and customer service.</p>

            <p>The Draft Assistant was built to take the blank-page problem off your team's plate. Tell it what you need &mdash; a social media post about your upcoming draw, an email to past ticket buyers, a press release about a grand prize winner &mdash; and it produces polished, publication-ready content that sounds like your organization wrote it.</p>

            <h2>Key capabilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple content types</strong> &mdash; Generate marketing emails, media releases, social media posts, ad copy, donor communications, and sponsor pitches from a single interface</li>
                <li><strong>Organization-aware</strong> &mdash; The Draft Assistant automatically pulls in your organization's details &mdash; name, mission, draw dates, prize structures, and branding language &mdash; so you never have to fill in boilerplate manually</li>
                <li><strong>Draw schedule integration</strong> &mdash; Your uploaded draw schedules are available as context, so the AI can reference correct dates, prize amounts, and ticket pricing without you looking them up</li>
                <li><strong>Tone and style selection</strong> &mdash; Choose the tone (exciting, professional, heartfelt) and format (long-form, bullet points, social-ready) that matches each piece of content</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative refinement</strong> &mdash; Generate a first draft, then refine with natural-language instructions: "make it shorter," "emphasize the early bird deadline," or "add a call to action"</li>
                <li><strong>Template library</strong> &mdash; Save your best drafts as templates for future campaigns. Build a library of proven content that your team can reference and adapt</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How teams use it</h2>
            <p>The most common Draft Assistant workflows we've seen from early operators include weekly social media content batches, where teams generate a full week's worth of posts in a single session. Others use it for rapid winner announcement cycles &mdash; from the moment a winner is confirmed to having a polished media release ready in under five minutes.</p>

            <p>Campaign launch sequences are another popular use case. Operators generate a coordinated set of content &mdash; launch email, social posts, website copy, and reminder emails &mdash; all in one sitting, ensuring consistent messaging across every channel.</p>

            <h3>What's next</h3>
            <p>The Draft Assistant will soon receive a major redesign with a two-column writing studio layout, giving teams more space to compose and refine content side by side. We're also exploring campaign templates and multi-channel content generation from a single brief.</p>
