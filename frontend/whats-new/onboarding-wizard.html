            <h1 class="wn-detail-title">Get Started in Minutes with the New Onboarding Wizard</h1>
            <p class="wn-detail-lede">We've replaced the old single-field setup modal with a guided five-step wizard that walks new organizations through everything they need to start using Lightspeed effectively.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="wn-detail-divider"><hr></div>

        <section class="wn-detail-body">
            <p>First impressions matter. When a new team signs up for Lightspeed, the first few minutes determine whether they'll get value from the platform or get stuck before they start. Our previous setup flow asked for an organization name and left users to figure out the rest on their own.</p>

            <p>The new onboarding wizard changes that entirely. It guides every new organization through five clear steps, ensuring they have the context, configuration, and knowledge base entries they need to hit the ground running.</p>

            <h2>The five steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organization profile</strong> &mdash; Set your organization name, type, and basic details that Lightspeed uses to tailor AI responses to your context</li>
                <li><strong>Team setup</strong> &mdash; Invite team members and assign roles so everyone has the right level of access from day one</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge base seeding</strong> &mdash; Add your first knowledge base entries, FAQs, or upload existing documentation so the AI has your organization's context</li>
                <li><strong>Tool configuration</strong> &mdash; Choose which Lightspeed tools to enable and configure their default settings for your workflow</li>
                <li><strong>Test drive</strong> &mdash; Generate your first AI response to see Lightspeed in action with your own data before going live</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why it matters</h2>
            <p>Organizations that complete the full onboarding wizard start with a richer knowledge base and more accurate AI responses from their very first interaction. Instead of discovering features over weeks, teams are productive from the start.</p>

            <p>The wizard is designed to take under five minutes while covering everything that previously required reading documentation or contacting support. Each step includes inline guidance and examples specific to charitable lottery operations.</p>

            <h3>What's next</h3>
            <p>We're continuing to refine the onboarding experience based on feedback from new users. Future improvements will include industry-specific templates and the ability to import knowledge bases from existing documentation.</p>
