            <h1 class="wn-detail-title">Lightspeed Now Connects to Your Shopify Store</h1>
            <p class="wn-detail-lede">Lightspeed's AI tools can now pull real-time product, order, and customer data directly from your Shopify store &mdash; giving your team instant context without switching between platforms.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="wn-detail-divider"><hr></div>

        <section class="wn-detail-body">
            <p>For lottery operators who sell merchandise, manage ticket sales through e-commerce, or run online storefronts alongside their lottery operations, switching between Shopify and customer service tools has always been a source of friction. Today, that friction disappears.</p>

            <p>With the new Shopify integration, Lightspeed connects directly to your Shopify store through a secure, read-only API. This means every AI-powered tool in Lightspeed &mdash; from the Response Assistant to Ask Lightspeed &mdash; now has access to the context it needs to answer product questions, look up order details, and reference customer information in real time.</p>

            <h2>What's included</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product catalog access</strong> &mdash; Lightspeed can reference your full Shopify product catalog including titles, descriptions, pricing, variants, and availability status</li>
                <li><strong>Order lookup</strong> &mdash; AI responses can pull order details including status, tracking information, and fulfillment data to help resolve customer inquiries faster</li>
                <li><strong>Customer context</strong> &mdash; When handling customer interactions, Lightspeed can reference relevant customer data to provide personalized, accurate responses</li>
                <li><strong>Read-only security</strong> &mdash; The integration uses read-only API access, ensuring your Shopify data can never be modified through Lightspeed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>The integration is configured at the organization level by your admin. Once connected, Lightspeed automatically enriches AI prompts with relevant Shopify data based on the context of each interaction. There's no need to manually search for products or orders &mdash; the AI understands when Shopify data is relevant and pulls it in automatically.</p>

            <p>All data is transmitted over encrypted connections and is never stored beyond the duration of a single request. Your Shopify credentials are stored securely using industry-standard encryption.</p>

            <h3>What's next</h3>
            <p>This is the first of several planned e-commerce integrations. We're exploring additional platforms and deeper data connections based on operator feedback. If there's a platform you'd like to see supported, let us know.</p>
