            <p class="wn-detail-lede">Lightspeed's Knowledge Base is the foundation that makes every AI tool accurate and consistent. Combined with the built-in feedback loop, it creates a system that continuously improves the more your team uses it.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="wn-detail-divider"><hr></div>

        <section class="wn-detail-body">
            <p>AI tools are only as good as the information they have access to. Generic AI assistants draw from the internet &mdash; a vast but unreliable source that knows nothing about your organization's specific policies, procedures, pricing, or voice. Lightspeed takes a fundamentally different approach: every AI response is grounded in your organization's Knowledge Base, a curated repository of the information that matters to your team.</p>

            <p>But a static knowledge base isn't enough. Policies change, new questions arise, and the AI occasionally gets things wrong. That's why Lightspeed pairs the Knowledge Base with a built-in feedback loop that turns every interaction into an opportunity to improve.</p>

            <h2>The Knowledge Base</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organized by category</strong> &mdash; Structure your knowledge into categories like Products, Policies, FAQs, Draw Information, and Custom categories that match your organization's needs</li>
                <li><strong>Tagged for discoverability</strong> &mdash; Add tags to entries so the AI can find the most relevant information quickly, even when a customer phrases their question in unexpected ways</li>
                <li><strong>Full CRUD management</strong> &mdash; Create, read, update, and delete entries through an intuitive interface. No technical expertise required</li>
                <li><strong>Used by all tools</strong> &mdash; Every Lightspeed tool &mdash; Response Assistant, Draft Assistant, Ask Lightspeed, and Rules of Play Generator &mdash; draws from the same Knowledge Base, ensuring consistency across all AI outputs</li>
                <li><strong>Organization-scoped</strong> &mdash; Each organization maintains its own Knowledge Base. Your data is completely isolated from other organizations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thumbs up / thumbs down</strong> &mdash; After every AI response, rate it with a single click. Thumbs up reinforces the approach. Thumbs down triggers a feedback flow</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback-to-KB pipeline</strong> &mdash; When you give a thumbs down, you can add a note explaining what was wrong. That feedback is used to create or update Knowledge Base entries automatically, closing the loop between a bad response and a better one next time</li>
                <li><strong>Inline KB editing</strong> &mdash; See a response that's almost right but references an outdated policy? Edit the underlying Knowledge Base entry directly from the feedback modal &mdash; no need to switch to the KB editor</li>
                <li><strong>Relevance scoring</strong> &mdash; Lightspeed tracks which Knowledge Base entries are most frequently used and most highly rated, surfacing the most reliable information first</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The compounding advantage</h2>
            <p>This is where Lightspeed differs most from generic AI tools. Every thumbs down makes the next response better. Every new Knowledge Base entry expands what the AI can answer accurately. Every feedback note sharpens the AI's understanding of your organization's standards.</p>

            <p>After weeks of use, teams find that the AI needs fewer corrections and produces responses that feel like they were written by the most experienced person on the team. This is the compounding effect of a system that learns from every interaction &mdash; and it's an advantage that grows over time.</p>

            <h3>What's next</h3>
            <p>We're continuing to improve the feedback loop with relevance-based filtering, rated-examples learning, and deeper Knowledge Base analytics that show you which entries drive the most value and which gaps need to be filled.</p>
