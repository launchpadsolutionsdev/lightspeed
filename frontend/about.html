                    <p class="about-mission-body">Charitable lottery operators and nonprofit teams deserve the same AI-powered efficiency that Fortune 500 companies take for granted. Lightspeed exists to close that gap &mdash; delivering purpose-built tools that handle the repetitive, time-consuming work so your team can focus on what actually moves the needle: fundraising, community impact, and growth.</p>

                    <h2 class="about-mission-headline">A world where team size doesn&rsquo;t limit what you can accomplish</h2>
                    <p class="about-mission-body">We&rsquo;re building toward a future where a three-person nonprofit team can operate with the speed, consistency, and reach of an organization ten times its size. Not by working harder, but by having AI tools that truly understand their work &mdash; tools that learn, adapt, and get smarter with every interaction.</p>

                    <div class="about-founder-bio">
                        <p>As Director of Lotteries at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Foundation, Torin runs one of Canada&rsquo;s largest hospital 50/50 lottery programs &mdash; a program that has generated over $180 million in total revenue for patient care.</p>
                        <p>But running a lottery of that scale with a small team meant relentless pressure on every front: thousands of customer inquiries per draw cycle, constant marketing demands, raw data that needed hours of manual processing, and contact lists that had to be cleaned and formatted before every campaign. The workload was unsustainable &mdash; and the off-the-shelf AI tools available simply didn&rsquo;t understand the nuances of lottery operations.</p>
                        <p>So Torin built Lightspeed. Starting from real-world pain points, he designed a platform trained on tens of thousands of actual customer interactions, marketing campaigns, and operational scenarios. The result is an AI toolkit that doesn&rsquo;t just generate generic responses &mdash; it genuinely understands the work, learns your organization&rsquo;s voice, and gets smarter every time you use it.</p>
                        <p>What started as an internal solution for one lottery team has grown into a platform serving charitable gaming operators who face the same challenge: doing more with less, without sacrificing quality or compliance.</p>
