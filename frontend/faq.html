                        <div class="landing-faq-answer-inner">Lightspeed is an AI-powered platform built specifically for nonprofits and charitable gaming/raffle operators. It includes five purpose-built tools &mdash; Response Assistant, Draft Assistant, Insights Engine, List Normalizer, and Ask Lightspeed &mdash; designed to handle customer service, content creation, data analytics, list management, and general tasks. Unlike generic AI tools, Lightspeed was trained on tens of thousands of real-world operational scenarios and uses machine learning to get smarter with every interaction. Organizations also receive an onboarding session where your personalized knowledge base is created, so Lightspeed knows who you are, and exactly how to help you.</div>

                        <div class="landing-faq-answer-inner">Lightspeed was built by Torin Gunnell, Director of Canada&rsquo;s largest hospital 50/50 lottery, which has generated over $180 million in revenue since 2021. Every tool in the platform was born from a real problem the team encountered during its monthly raffles and marketing campaigns.</div>

                        <div class="landing-faq-answer-inner">Consumer AI tools are general-purpose &mdash; they can do a lot, but they don&rsquo;t deeply understand lottery operations, customer service cases; and they don&rsquo;t know you. They also lose context over time and require constant retraining. Lightspeed is the opposite. It was purpose-built for nonprofits, raffles and lottery workflows, trained on real operational data, and powered by machine learning that never forgets. The more you use it, the smarter and more accurate it becomes. It&rsquo;s also packaged in a simple interface that volunteers and anyone on your team can use immediately &mdash; no prompt engineering required.</div>
