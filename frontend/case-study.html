                    <p>Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Foundation operates the Thunder Bay 50/50 &mdash; Canada&rsquo;s largest hospital 50/50 lottery. Since launching in January 2021, the program has generated over $180 million in total revenue, supporting patient care at Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre.</p>

                    <h2 class="cs-section-title">The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Running a lottery of this scale with a small team meant relentless pressure on every front. During each draw cycle, thousands of customer inquiries poured in &mdash; questions about ticket purchases, draw schedules, winner announcements, technical issues, and more. Every single one required a thoughtful, accurate, and compliant response. There was no room for shortcuts.</p>
                    <p>But customer service was only one piece of the puzzle. The same small team was also responsible for writing marketing emails, social media copy, media releases, and ad content for every campaign. To understand where tickets were selling, who was buying, and how to optimize future draws, raw customer data had to be manually normalized, analyzed, and broken down into geographic and demographic insights. Contact lists required constant cleaning, deduplication, and formatting before they could be uploaded to email platforms for outreach.</p>
                    <p>Every one of these tasks was being done manually &mdash; and for a team of this size, the workload had become unsustainable.</p>

                <section class="cs-section">
                    <h2 class="cs-section-title">The Search for a Solution</h2>
                    <p>Off-the-shelf AI tools weren&rsquo;t the answer. Generic chatbots and writing assistants didn&rsquo;t understand the nuances of lottery operations &mdash; the regulatory language, the compliance requirements, the specific types of customer questions that come with a live 50/50 draw.</p>
                    <p>Consumer AI platforms can &ldquo;technically&rdquo; be trained on a knowledge base, but they come with a critical limitation: they lose context over time. The longer you use them, the more they forget. Conversations drift, knowledge bases need to be re-uploaded, and teams find themselves constantly retraining the same tool on the same information. It&rsquo;s like hiring someone new every few weeks and starting from scratch. Solving complex individual customer support issues related to tickets, subscriptions, questions about draw regulations etc; required senior team members to handle directly.</p>
                    <p>The team needed something fundamentally different &mdash; a platform that never forgets, only gets smarter, and has essentially unlimited memory bandwidth. Something that retains every interaction, every correction, every piece of organizational knowledge permanently, and compounds that intelligence over time rather than losing it.</p>
                    <p>It also needed to be simple. Not everyone on a nonprofit team is technical. The solution had to be packaged into an interface that anyone could pick up and use immediately &mdash; no training manuals, no prompt engineering, no learning curve. Just open it and go.</p>

                <section class="cs-section">
                    <h2 class="cs-section-title">The Solution: Lightspeed</h2>
                    <p>Torin Gunnell, Director of Lotteries, began building what would eventually become Lightspeed &mdash; an AI platform designed specifically for nonprofits and raffle operations.</p>
                    <p>Rather than starting from a blank slate, Lightspeed was trained on tens of thousands of real-world interactions, customer inquiries, marketing campaigns, and operational scenarios accumulated over years of running live draws. This gave the platform an immediate depth of understanding that generic AI tools simply don&rsquo;t have.</p>
                    <p>Lightspeed was also built with machine learning at its core. The more the team used it, the smarter it got &mdash; continuously refining its responses, learning the organization&rsquo;s voice, and improving its accuracy over time.</p>
                    <p>The platform includes five purpose-built tools:</p>
